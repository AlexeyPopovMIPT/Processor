# 4. Processor
The task is to 
- create your own low-level instruction set
- write an assembler program that will convert .asm file with instructions into "executable" file
- write a (command prompt) program - virtual machine that will execute that file
- write a disassembler program for executable to .asm conversion
- provide a convenient way to change instruction set

Last point is done through adding .json file describing instruction set and a simple C# program that generates snippets with all required information about instruction set.
